# ParkJ

With ParkJ you can convert pictures and later videos to text in the terminal. The code is based on The Science Elf's Video-to-Text terminal-based application but with a new basic GUI written in Python.

At the moment it only really works in the Windows Terminal. Which is the standard in Windows 11 and installable from the Microsoft Store in Windows 10.
